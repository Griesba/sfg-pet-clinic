#dependency injection: how object is initialized with dependents object
#dependency inversion: details should depend on abstraction (not the opposite)


#dependency injection vs IoC
  dependency injection is class composition. You compose your classes with depency injection in mind.
  IoC is the runtime environment of your code. ie Springframework's IoC container. Spring is in control of the injection of dependency.
